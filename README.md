# Belimbing (BLB)

An open-source **business process framework** that democratizes enterprise-grade capabilities for businesses of all sizes. Built on Laravel, Belimbing empowers businesses to build, customize, and own their operational systems — ERP, CRM, HR, logistics, or any custom process — without vendor lock-in or prohibitive costs.

Belimbing is a **framework**, not a SaaS platform. Businesses fork the repo, build on top of it, and self-host — keeping full ownership of their code, data, and infrastructure.

## What Makes Belimbing Different

- **Open Source Forever (AGPLv3)** — Self-hosted, transparent, zero licensing fees
- **AI-Native Architecture** — Built to leverage AI in development, customization, and operation
- **Quality-Obsessed** — Ousterhout's design principles, performance-first, exceptional UX
- **Git-Native Workflow** — Development → Staging → Production via version control
- **Deep Customization** — Extension system with hooks at every layer; businesses build what they need

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Laravel 12+ (PHP 8.2+), PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Frontend:** Livewire Volt, Tailwind CSS 4, Alpine.js
- **Tooling:** Vite, Pest PHP, Laravel Pint

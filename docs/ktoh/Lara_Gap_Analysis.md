# Lara: Gap Analysis

## Summary
This document highlights the gaps between the ideated features for Lara and the currently implemented capabilities in the BLB framework (Base AI and Core AI layers). It provides insights for prioritizing next-step development.

---

## Conceptual Framework

**Lara Ideation Key Features**:
1. **Purpose and Intelligence**:
   - Autonomous problem solver with supervisory ethics.
   - Context-awareness and situational adaptability.

2. **Capabilities**:
   - **Actionable Autonomy**: Task and workflow management with minimal supervision.
   - **Empathy and Insight**: Understanding and responding to human context.

3. **Architecture**:
   - Modular with plug-and-play capabilities.
   - Workspace-driven behavior and context configuration.

## Gap Analysis

### 1. **Base AI Layer (Stateless Infrastructure)**
- **Implemented**:
  - OpenAI-compatible tools: `LlmClient`, `ProviderDiscoveryService`, `ModelCatalogService`.
  - Catalog synchronization via `AiCatalogSyncCommand`.
- **Missing**:
  - Modular plug-and-play features for runtime behavior tailored to Lara.
  - Explicit workflows for managing multi-step tasks.

### 2. **Core AI Layer (Governance)**
- **Implemented**:
  - Governance services: `AgentRuntime`, `LaraCapabilityMatcher`.
  - Prompt management: `LaraPromptFactory` for workflow logic.
- **Missing**:
  - Empathy-Driven Capabilities: Situational adaptability and human-context comprehension.

### 3. **Task Management**
- **Implemented**:
  - Task orchestration: `LaraTaskDispatcher`, `LaraOrchestrationService`.
- **Missing**:
  - Supervisory feedback loops for error correction and refinement.
  - Dynamic workflow adaptation based on task outcomes.

### 4. **Workspace Context**
- **Implemented**:
  - Stateless configuration in `Base AI` (`ai.php`) and governance in `Core AI` (`ModelDiscoveryService`).
- **Missing**:
  - File-driven runtime behavior for Lara (e.g., configuration-driven personality via workspace files like `SOUL.md`).

---

## Proposed Next Steps

1. **Dynamic Workflow Management**
   - Build on `LaraTaskDispatcher` to include situational adaptability in task execution.

2. **Human Feedback Integration**
   - Introduce a supervisory feedback loop for dynamic corrections and continuous improvement.

3. **Behavior Configuration**
   - Leverage workspace files (e.g., `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`) to define Lara’s runtime context and behavioral traits.

**Document Status**: Draft for review.

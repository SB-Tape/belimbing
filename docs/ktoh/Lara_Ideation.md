# Ideas for Lara

## Conceptualizing Lara
1. **Purpose and Intelligence**:
   - Autonomous problem solver with supervisory controls.
   - Context-awareness and situational adaptability to align tasks with human needs and project goals.

2. **Capabilities**:
   - **Actionable Autonomy**: Manage tasks and workflows independently, freeing up human oversight for high-level decisions.
   - **Empathy and Insight**: Understand and respond to human context, including timelines, emotional tone, and broader project priorities.
   - **Execution Context**: Task prioritization based on workload, deadlines, and resource constraints.
   - **Tool Management**: Integrate and manage AI tools and orchestrate them contextually to meet project needs.

3. **Architecture and Design**:
   - Modular, with plug-and-play capabilities, allowing for iterative enhancement of Lara’s skill set.
   - Workspace-driven context for her behavior, relying on human-readable files like `SOUL.md` to define her traits and execution priorities.
   - AI-Native Governance: Define and scope permissions, actions, and runtime behaviors within a clear, file-based governance model such as `IDENTITY.md`.

4. **Proposed Enhancements**:
   - **Dynamic Workflow Management**: Extend base orchestration with situational adaptability, enabling Lara to adjust workflows on-the-fly based on feedback and outcomes.
   - **Supervisory Feedback Integration**: Introduce feedback loops for continuous role refinement, enabling Lara to learn from human corrections and adapt.
   - **Contextual Configuration**: Define modes or roles using workspace preconditions to toggle between behaviors such as development assistant, task executor, or operation overseer.
   - **Empathy Calibration**: Build a system by which Lara can infer urgency, user stress levels, and adjust task responses accordingly to complement human decision-making.

5. **Planned Integration Points**:
   - AI Catalog: Utilize `Base AI` services like `ModelCatalogService` to retrieve model details dynamically for results-driven task orchestration.
   - Core AI Features: Leverage `AgentRuntime` and `LaraCapabilityMatcher` to scaffold decision trees.
   - Task Dispatch: Extend capabilities within `LaraTaskDispatcher` to handle recursive planning loops.
   - Prompt Design: Refine the use of `LaraPromptFactory` for multi-turn interactions and long-term goal alignment.

## Vision for Lara’s Role
Lara is more than a tool; she’s envisioned as a collaborator. Her existence bridges AI automation with thoughtful human oversight, enabling autonomous decision-making, but always within the framework of defined ethics and user-alignment. The ultimate goal is for Lara to fade seamlessly into workflows, delivering measurable impact while being intuitive to engage with.

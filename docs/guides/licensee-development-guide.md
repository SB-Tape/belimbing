# Adopter Separation Strategy

**Document Type:** Architecture Guide
**Purpose:** How licensees develop custom code on top of BLB without merge conflicts or architectural drift
**Audience:** BLB framework team, licensee developers, implementation partners
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-22

## 1. Problem Statement

A licensee needs custom modules, branding, and business logic. BLB must keep evolving. The two codebases must coexist in the same repository without interfering.

---

## 2. Design Goals

1. **Simple** — standard Git, no special tooling.
2. **Flexible** — licensees can add unlimited modules with no artificial constraints.
3. **Scalable** — works for one module or fifty.
4. **Maintainable** — upstream sync (`git pull`) is near-conflict-free by directory design.
5. **Logical** — backend in `extensions/`, UI in `resources/extensions/{licensee}/`, same patterns as BLB core.

---

## 3. Model: Fork + Directory Convention

One fork. No branch lanes. No worktrees. Separation is enforced by **directory placement**, not by branching ceremony.

### 3.1 Repository Topology

```text
upstream:  BelimbingApp/belimbing         # BLB framework
origin:    {licensee}/belimbing (fork)    # Licensee's fork
```

### 3.2 How It Works

1. Licensee forks `BelimbingApp/belimbing`.
2. Adds upstream remote: `git remote add upstream <BelimbingApp/belimbing URL>`.
3. Develops on `main` (or feature branches — their choice).
4. Syncs upstream regularly: `git pull upstream main`.

Merge conflicts are structurally near-impossible because BLB never touches `extensions/{licensee}/` or `resources/extensions/{licensee}/`.

### 3.3 Why a Fork

BLB is a framework where `app/` IS the framework — not a Composer package. The licensee's custom code lives alongside it in the same tree. A fork is the simplest, most standard way to version-control this.

Alternatives considered and rejected:

| Alternative | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Separate extension repo (gitignored) | Licensee code spans `extensions/` and `resources/`. Two repos to deploy, compose, and keep in sync. |
| Git subtree/submodule | Same two-location problem plus arcane git commands. |
| BLB as Composer package | Would require extracting all of `app/Base/` and `app/Modules/` into a package. Wrong abstraction for a framework-on-top-of-Laravel. |

---

## 4. File Placement Boundaries

BLB and licensee code are separated by directory, not by branch. Follow `docs/architecture/file-structure.md`.

### 4.1 Ownership Map

| Owner | Backend Code | UI / Presentation |
|---|---|---|
| **BLB framework** | `app/Base/`, `app/Modules/` | `resources/core/` |
| **Licensee** | `extensions/{licensee}/{module}/` | `resources/extensions/{licensee}/` |

Both follow the same structural patterns. The menu discovery glob (`extensions/*/*/Config/menu.php`) already supports this.

### 4.2 Extension Module Structure

Every extension module mirrors BLB's internal module structure (include only what's needed):

```
extensions/{owner}/{module}/
├── Config/
│   ├── menu.php              # Menu items (auto-discovered)
│   ├── authz.php             # Authorization rules
│   └── {module}.php          # Module config (lowercase filename)
├── Database/
│   ├── Migrations/
│   └── Seeders/
├── Livewire/
├── Models/
├── Services/
├── Routes/
│   └── web.php
├── Tests/
└── ServiceProvider.php
```

Tests live inside the extension module (`Tests/`) rather than under `tests/extensions/`. The module is the unit of deployment — deleting or moving a module should remove its tests too. Unlike `resources/`, where Blade and CSS resolution requires a centralized path that Vite and Laravel can scan, tests have no framework-imposed path constraint and benefit more from co-location.

### 4.3 ServiceProvider Registration

BLB auto-discovers providers inside `app/Base/` and `app/Modules/` via `ProviderRegistry`. Extension providers fall outside those scan paths, so they must be registered explicitly in `bootstrap/providers.php`:

```php
return ProviderRegistry::resolve(
    appProviders: [
        App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
        \Extensions\SbGroup\Quality\ServiceProvider::class,
    ]
);
```

Routes and menus are discovered automatically via globs (`extensions/*/*/Routes`, `extensions/*/*/Config/menu.php`), but the ServiceProvider itself requires this one-time registration step.

### 4.4 Database Table Naming

Use owner-prefixed table names to prevent collisions with BLB core and other extensions:

```
{owner}_{module}_{entity}
```

Examples: `sbg_quality_work_items`, `acme_reporting_dashboards`.

Reference: `docs/guides/extensions/database-migrations.md`.

### 4.5 UI Boundary in `resources/`

BLB uses a core/licensee split. Licensee overrides win by CSS cascade and Blade view resolution order.

| UI Concern | BLB Core | Licensee |
|---|---|---|
| Design tokens | `resources/core/css/tokens.css` | `resources/extensions/{licensee}/css/tokens.css` |
| Component styles | `resources/core/css/components.css` | `resources/extensions/{licensee}/css/components.css` |
| Blade components | `resources/core/views/components/` | `resources/extensions/{licensee}/views/components/` |
| Livewire page templates | `resources/core/views/livewire/` | `resources/extensions/{licensee}/views/livewire/` |

Rules:

1. Prefer token override and component override before copying full page templates.
2. Set `VITE_THEME_DIR={licensee}` in `.env` to activate the licensee layer.
3. Licensee-specific branding, terminology, and layout go in `resources/extensions/{licensee}/`. Improvements to BLB-wide usability go in `resources/core/` and are contributed upstream.

References: `docs/architecture/ui-layout.md`, `docs/guides/theming.md`.

## 5. Decision Rubric: BLB Core vs Licensee Extension

Before coding, ask four questions:

1. Is the naming domain-neutral (not licensee terminology)?
2. Is the behavior useful for at least one other adopter scenario?
3. Can it be exposed as a small, stable interface with hidden complexity?
4. Can licensee-specific policy be implemented as configuration, extension, or guard class outside core?

**All yes** → implement in `app/Base/` or `app/Modules/`, contribute upstream.
**Any no** → implement in `extensions/{licensee}/`.

---

## 6. Upstream Contributions

When a licensee builds something reusable:

1. Extract the generic behavior from `extensions/{licensee}/{module}/`.
2. Rename domain-specific terms to neutral language.
3. Implement in `app/Base/` or `app/Modules/` with tests.
4. Open PR to `BelimbingApp/belimbing`.
5. Once merged, remove the duplicate from licensee extension and use the upstream version.

No "promotion flow" ceremony — it's a standard PR.

---

## 7. Pull Request Discipline

1. **Upstream PRs** must not include `extensions/{licensee}/` or `resources/extensions/{licensee}/` paths.
2. **Licensee commits** should not modify BLB core (`app/Base/`, `app/Modules/`, `resources/core/`) unless patching an urgent blocker.
3. If an urgent licensee fix touches core, follow immediately with either:
   - a PR contributing the reusable part upstream, or
   - a revert-and-reimplement in extension space.

---

## 8. Third-Party Extensions

Third-party vendors use the same `extensions/{vendor}/{module}/` layout:

```
extensions/
├── sb-group/              # Licensee
│   ├── quality/
│   └── logistics/
├── acme-corp/             # Another licensee
│   └── hr/
└── some-vendor/           # Third-party vendor
    └── reporting/
```

### 8.1 Distribution Options

| Method | When to use | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| **Git (directory in fork)** | Licensee modules, private vendor code | Files live directly in `extensions/{owner}/{module}/`. Deployed with the fork. |
| **Composer package** | Open-source or commercially distributed extensions | Package installs into `vendor/` as usual. A post-install script or ServiceProvider publishes/symlinks assets into `extensions/{vendor}/{module}/` so that glob-based discovery (routes, menus) works unchanged. |

### 8.2 Composer Package Convention (Future)

When BLB supports Composer-distributed extensions, packages should:

1. Use the Composer type `belimbing-extension`.
2. Register their ServiceProvider via Laravel's `extra.laravel.providers` auto-discovery.
3. Publish routes, config, and menu files into `extensions/{vendor}/{module}/` so existing glob patterns discover them automatically.
4. Prefix database tables with `{vendor}_{module}_` per section 4.4.

This keeps the runtime directory layout identical regardless of distribution method.

## 9. Example: SBG Quality Extension

```text
extensions/sb-group/quality/
├── Config/
│   ├── menu.php
│   ├── authz.php
│   └── quality.php
├── Database/
│   ├── Migrations/
│   │   ├── 2026_03_22_000000_create_sbg_quality_work_items_table.php
│   │   └── 2026_03_22_000001_create_sbg_quality_status_history_table.php
│   └── Seeders/
│       └── QualityWorkflowSeeder.php
├── Livewire/
│   └── Quality/...
├── Models/
│   └── QualityWorkItem.php
├── Routes/
│   └── web.php
├── Tests/
└── ServiceProvider.php
```

UI overrides for SBG:

```text
resources/extensions/sb-group/
├── css/
│   └── tokens.css           # SBG brand colors
├── views/
│   ├── components/          # Component overrides
│   └── livewire/            # Page template overrides
└── js/
```

## 10. Operational Checklist

1. Fork `BelimbingApp/belimbing` and add upstream remote.
2. Place all licensee code in `extensions/{licensee}/` and `resources/extensions/{licensee}/`.
3. Use owner-prefixed table names (`{owner}_{module}_{entity}`).
4. Set `VITE_THEME_DIR={licensee}` in `.env`.
5. Sync upstream regularly: `git pull upstream main`.
6. Review file paths before commit — licensee code must not touch BLB core.
7. Contribute reusable improvements upstream via PR.
